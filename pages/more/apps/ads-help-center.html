    <h1>Understanding Advertising in Our Applications</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Our commitment to transparency, accountability, and respect for user autonomy is central to the way we design and operate our applications. Advertising plays an essential role in ensuring that our products remain freely available while supporting the ongoing development, maintenance, and improvement of our services. This page provides a clear and comprehensive explanation of our advertising practices, the choices available to you, and the safeguards we apply to uphold your privacy and regulatory rights.</p>

    <h2>Why We Use Advertising</h2>
    <h3>Supporting Accessibility</h3>
    <p>Advertising enables us to offer our applications without requiring direct payment. This approach ensures that our tools and services remain accessible to a broad user base, regardless of financial circumstances. Rather than limiting features behind a paywall, advertising allows us to sustain development while keeping the core user experience open and inclusive.</p>
    <h3>Funding Product Development</h3>
    <p>Revenue generated through advertising allows us to invest in new features, security enhancements, user interface refinements, and long-term performance improvements. This financial model enables continuous innovation and responsiveness to user feedback, fostering a product ecosystem that evolves with your needs.</p>
    <h3>Ensuring Sustainability</h3>
    <p>By responsibly incorporating advertising, we can maintain long-term service availability, offer timely updates, and support the infrastructure that underpins our applications. This model helps balance operational sustainability with the goal of maintaining a respectful, user-first experience.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Personalized Advertising</h2>
    <h3>Use of the Advertising ID</h3>
    <p>Our applications may use the Google Advertising ID, a unique, user-resettable identifier provided by the Android operating system. This identifier enables advertisers to deliver relevant ads without accessing personally identifiable information.</p>
    <p>The Advertising ID is used solely for purposes such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Limiting the number of times an ad is shown</li>
        <li>Ensuring ads are displayed appropriately for your region or language</li>
        <li>Supporting non-intrusive ad personalization (if you have explicitly opted in)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use the Advertising ID to track users across apps or combine it with any sensitive data. Additionally, our apps respect your system-level privacy preferences; if you choose to reset or restrict the use of your Advertising ID, we honor that choice.</p>
    <p>This approach allows us to provide a balanced ad experience while maintaining compliance with Google Play requirements and international privacy standards.</p>

    <h3>Purpose and Function</h3>
    <p>Personalized advertising refers to the display of advertisements that are more likely to be relevant to your interests, based on non-sensitive signals such as general app usage patterns. This approach seeks to reduce irrelevant content and improve the overall value of the advertising you encounter.</p>
    <h3>User Benefits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Relevance:</strong> Personalized ads are designed to reflect your preferences and behavior in a manner that enhances utility without disrupting your experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Discovery:</strong> Users often encounter helpful products, services, or content they may not have otherwise found.</li>
        <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Personalization helps align advertising with your expectations, contributing to a more consistent and coherent application environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Importantly, personalized ads do not involve the collection or use of sensitive information such as messages, contacts, or personal files. All data used for this purpose is processed in accordance with applicable privacy standards and is subject to your explicit control.</p>

    <h2>Your Control Over Advertising</h2>
    <p>We believe that meaningful consent and ongoing control are essential to a trustworthy digital environment. As such, our applications include an Ad Settings section within the Privacy menu, where you can manage your advertising preferences.</p>
    <h3>Available Options</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Ads:</strong> You may choose whether or not ads are shown in the application. If this option is turned off, the app will operate without showing advertising content.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalized Ads:</strong> You may enable or disable the personalization of ads. When disabled, you will continue to see general advertisements that are not based on usage signals or inferred interests.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Options:</strong> You may access a consent and privacy preferences interface that allows you to review, modify, or withdraw your choices at any time.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These settings are designed to be simple to access and modify at your discretion.</p>

    <h2>Privacy and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>We take user privacy seriously and strictly adhere to international and regional data protection regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, where applicable.</p>
    <h3>Consent Requirements</h3>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), the United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you will be presented with a clear and compliant consent form prior to any processing of personal data for advertising purposes. This form will inform you of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The nature and purpose of the data collected</li>
        <li>The parties involved in data processing</li>
        <li>Your rights, including the right to refuse or withdraw consent without penalty</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may withdraw your consent at any time from the appâ€™s privacy settings, in full accordance with applicable law.</p>
    <h3>Trusted Partnerships</h3>
    <p>We only partner with advertising providers who:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Comply with recognized industry standards</li>
        <li>Are committed to transparent data practices</li>
        <li>Operate under contractual obligations aligned with privacy legislation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No personal data is sold to third parties. Advertisers may receive non-identifiable information solely for the purpose of delivering relevant advertising content.</p>

    <h2>Protection for Young Users</h2>
    <p>Where required, we apply special measures to protect users who may be under the age of digital consent. In such cases, we restrict the delivery of personalized ads and limit data collection to the minimum required for the app to function.</p>
    <p>We remain vigilant in implementing protections that reflect legal obligations and ethical responsibilities, particularly for vulnerable users.</p>

    <h2>Our Ongoing Commitment</h2>
    <p>We continuously evaluate our advertising practices to ensure they reflect evolving legal standards and societal expectations. This includes regular assessments of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consent mechanisms</li>
        <li>Partner compliance</li>
        <li>User experience feedback</li>
        <li>Privacy impact</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are committed to building products that respect your time, attention, and autonomy. Advertising is integrated only where it adds measurable value to your experience and our long-term mission of product accessibility and excellence.</p>
